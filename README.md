## About

Radix Svelte is meant to be used as a base for your own styles and components. It offers:

- Treeshakable components with individual parts that can be styled separately
- Typescript and SvelteKit support out-of-the-box
- Strict adherence to WAI-ARIA guidelines
- Easy to use examples and documentation
- A high emphasis on accessibility, extensibility, quality and consistency

While Radix Svelte is not a 1:1 reimplementation of Radix UI Primitives, we follow the same principles, patterns, and goals outlined by them on their site. Any changes that may be introduced as a part of porting it to Svelte will be documented and mentioned accordingly.

## Getting started

Install the `radix-svelte` package with your package manager of choice:

```sh
npm install radix-svelte
yarn add radix-svelte
pnpm add radix-svelte
bun add radix-svelte
```

Import the components to your code and start using them:

```html
<script>
    import { Toggle } from 'radix-svelte';

    let pressed = false;
</script>

<Toggle.Root bind:pressed>
    {pressed ? 'Pressed' : 'Not pressed'}
</Toggle.Root>
```
